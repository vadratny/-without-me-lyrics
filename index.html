<font color="00FF00"><br>Obie Trice
<br>Real name no gimmicks 
<br>Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
<br>Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
<br>Guess who's back, back again
<br>Shady's back, tell a friend
<br>Guess who's back
<br>Guess who's back
<br>Guess who's back
<br>Guess who's back
<br>Guess who's back
<br>Guess who's back
<br>Guess who's back
<br>I've created a monster
<br>'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
<br>They want Shady I'm chopped liver
<br>Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
<br>A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
<br>Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
<br>Quicker than a shock
<br>When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
<br>When I'm not cooperating
<br>When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
<br>You waited this long now stop debating
<br>'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating
<br>I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
<br>But your husband's heart problem's complicating
<br>So the FCC won't let me be
<br>Or let me be me so let me see
<br>They try to shut me down on MTV
<br>But it feels so empty without me
<br>So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
<br>Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
<br>I just settled all my lawsuits
<br>Fuck you, Debbie!
<br>Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
<br>'Cause we need a little controversy
<br>'Cause it feels so empty without me
<br>I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
<br>'Cause we need a little controversy
<br>'Cause it feels so empty without me
<br>Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
<br>Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
<br>They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
<br>'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"
<br>A visionary, vision is scary
<br>Could start a revolution
<br>Polluting the air waves a rebel
<br>So just let me revel and bask
<br>In the fact that I <font color="1224F2">got</font> everyone kissing my ass
<br>And it's a disaster
<br>Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
<br>You ask for me?
<br>Well I'm back
<br>Fix your bent antennae
<br>Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
<br>And up under your skin like a splinter
<br>The center of attention back for the winter
<br>I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
<br>Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
<br>Testing attention please
<br>Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
<br>Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
<br>A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
<br>Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
<br>'Cause we need a little controversy
<br>'Cause it feels so empty without me
<br>I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
<br>'Cause we need a little controversy
<br>'Cause it feels so empty without me
<br>A tisk-it a task-it
<br>I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
<br>Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
<br>Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
<br>And Moby
<br>You can get stomped by Obie
<br>You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
<br>You don't know me
<br>You're too old
<br>Let go
<br>It's over, nobody listens to techno
<br>Now let's go, just give me the signal
<br>I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
<br>I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
<br>Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
<br>But sometimes the shit just seems
<br>Everybody only wants to discuss me
<br>So this must mean I'm disgusting
<br>But it's just me I'm just obscene
<br>No, I'm not the first king of controversy
<br>I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
<br>To do black music so selfishly
<br>And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
<br>There's a concept that works
<br>20 million other white rappers emerge
<br>But no matter how many fish in the sea
<br>It'd be so empty without me
<br>Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
<br>'Cause we need a little controversy
<br>'Cause it feels so empty without me
<br>I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
<br>'Cause we need a little controversy
<br>'Cause it feels so empty without me</font>
